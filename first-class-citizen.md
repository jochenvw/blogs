# What's a first class citizen?

After having heard the Lex Fridman podcast episode with the [cursor.ai](https://lexfridman.com/cursor-team) I was excitedly talking about this with a good friend. In reponse to my attempt to boil down what I think cursor is trying to do, I said something like 'they're putting AI at the core of the editor, as a first-class citizen - not an extension'. To which he replied 'so that is that *really* - a 'first-class citizen?'. Good question.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen#:~:text=In%20a%20given%20programming%20language,and%20assigned%20to%20a%20variable.) says:

> In a given programming language design, a first-class citizen is an entity which supports all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically > include being passed as an argument, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable.
